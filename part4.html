                <p class="part-four-text"> &nbsp &nbsp Financial burdens of achieving my dream would be student loans if no financial aid or scholarships are granted. Student loans amount to on average $24,035 and the starting salary would be around $59,892. My American Dream reflects my personal values since the accomplishments I hope to achieve in my future are things that I am truly capable of acquiring with hard work and dedication. My personal value is that anyone can do anything with hard work and dedication which directly correlates to my American Dream. Physical, emotional or psychological benefits that exist are that when achieving my American Dream my confidence will be through the roof which will present a huge emotional and psychological reward.</p>
                <p class="part-four-text"> &nbsp &nbsp I feel that I’ve always known what I wanted for my American Dream. It's just I’ve never really planned it out or put it into words. I have learned what material or emotional possessions that I really want to have at certain ages and what my overall life goal is. I feel that my thinking didn’t really change throughout this process but it did make me think deeper about my future and the process of my American Dream.</p>
