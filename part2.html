            <p class="part-two-text"><b>Pick one text we read in class this year and discuss how it DOES reflect one of the definitions:</b> <br>A text we read in class, A Raisin in the Sun, connects to Martin Luther King, Jr’s American Dream. A Raisin in the Sun connects to Martin Luther King, Jr’s American Dream because the plot and American Dream follow the idea of having a nation where they want to be not judged by the color of their skin but the content of their character. This is shown when Mama and Big Walter move to the new house in essentially an all white community.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>What have you or can you do in high school to start on your journey?</b> <br>What I have done in high school to start my journey is that I have taken two coding classes and will continue to take more throughout the rest of high school. What I can also do to explore my options is take a Cybersecurity class at PATH’s or engineering class here at Portland.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>What high school accomplishments or achievements are required?</b> <br>The basic high school accomplishment for myself is to receive my high school diploma with high honors. Another accomplishment for me would be to have a great basketball season the next two years to possibly obtain a scholarship.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>What education, training, or experiences are required and how long will that take (approximately how many years)?</b> <br>I first need to acquire my diploma then, I need to go to college to earn a Bachelor’s Degree in the engineering field or computer science depending on what I’m interested in. Training would depend on the certain job I’m applying for and so would apprenticeship.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>Are there any internships or other unpaid requirements necessary to enter your desired career field?</b> <br>Apprenticeships are usually required but not always. When going into engineering an internship would definitely be a good thing to have on my resume depending on the certain type I am going into.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>What possible professional certifications/ tests are required to enter your preferred field?</b> <br>The possible professional certifications or tests required for engineering would be a licensure for engineers that all states require when offering engineering services to the public.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>What personal milestones might be part of your journey (ex. marriage, kids, home buying)?</b> <br>The personal milestones that might be a part of my journey would be marriage, two kids if my spouse and I decide to have any and a very nice two story home on the lakefront.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>Where do you need/ want to live in order to achieve your dream?</b> <br>I could live anywhere to achieve my dream but I would like to remain in New England since most of my family is here.</br></p>
            <p class="part-two-text"><b>How will you know when you have completed your dream?</b> <br>How I will know when I completed my dream is when I retire early with a perfect family, perfect living situation and a perfect lifestyle.</br></p>
